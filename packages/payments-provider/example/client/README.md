# How to use

This is an example of how to use the `@safe-global/auth-provider` package.

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

This example can be used as a playground to test the package as it is relatively imported from the root of the project.

```typescript
import { SafeAuth, SafeAuthProviderType, SafeAuthSignInData } from '../../src/index'
```
